# Valence App (Experiment 2)
This is an experiment about how people form illusory correlations when one variable has positive or negative valence. The point here is to manipulate whether "positive" means adding bonus money or not-subtracting bonus money (same for "negative" in reverse: removing money or simply not adding money).
