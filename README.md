# Valence App (Pilot Study)
This is an experiment about how people learn about cause/effect relationships in which the effect has positive or negative valence.


The previous version had different pages and accompanying handlers for the scenario (in which participants make trial-by-trial predictions), the causal strength judgment, and the memory questions. This one puts them all on the same page, with different page objects for each one. 

The previous version was also not compatible with the use of the "back" button. This version is (hypothetically...) capable of dealing with the back button and the refresh button (by putting participants back where they left off when they get back to the page).
